# **FizzBuzz in JavaScript**  
A classic coding challenge implemented in JavaScript. This project demonstrates a clean, efficient, and scalable solution to the FizzBuzz problem, perfect for beginners and interview prep!  

## **What is FizzBuzz?**  
FizzBuzz is a popular programming task where:  
- For multiples of **3**, print `"Fizz"`.  
- For multiples of **5**, print `"Buzz"`.  
- For multiples of **both 3 and 5**, print `"FizzBuzz"`.  
- Otherwise, print the number itself.  

This project showcases how to solve FizzBuzz while emphasizing **clean code**, **modularity**, and **best practices**.
